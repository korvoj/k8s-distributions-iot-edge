# Execution Information

All of the scripts present in this folder accept two mandatory arguments:

- the OpenFaaS admin password, as the first argument
- the OpenFaaS Gateway endpoint, as the second argument

In case a username different than `admin` is used or the OpenFaaS Gateway uses a non-standard port different than `443`, then these declaration can easily be changed at the beginning of each script.
